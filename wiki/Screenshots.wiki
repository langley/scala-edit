The colors and font sizes can be modified by changing properties:

The built-in Scala and sbt terminals can be used as native "terminals". (A problem with JLine makes this work bad on windows. The multiline editor can be used as well.)

ScalaEdit has a find/replace command and shortcuts for common commands(See the help menu).
